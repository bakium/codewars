/* DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper.

But for a change, let"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.

*should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.

"apple"            => "Apple"
"apple of banana"  => "Apple of Banana"
"one   space"      => "One   Space"
"   space WALK   " => "   Space Walk   "

Note: you will be provided atleast one word and should take string as input and return string as output.
